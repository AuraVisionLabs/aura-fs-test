## Aura Vision Full Stack Developer Test

- This repo contains a front end app with a well defined structure
- It also contains a very very barebones express API server with no structure
- The app should allow the user to search for flights

## Task 1

### Extend the API so that it can accomodate queries

- Allow a client to query the flight data by origin, destination and/or dates
- The API side of this application is incredibly barebones on purpose because we're more interested in how you'd structure this back end service. It should use Node/Express though.
- Think about what you'd need if this was a real API, e.g. request validation, and other things.

## Task 2

### Extend this front end application so that a user can search for available flights by date

- Use the API you created to allow users to search for flights by origin, destination and dates.
- Ensure any conventions already present in this FE app are followed
- Pay some attention to the UI/UX, e.g. how dates and times might be presented. We're looking for skills in being able to quickly present a view in a half-decent way, we're not looking for designers!
